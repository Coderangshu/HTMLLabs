Form basics

In this activity, you will practice creating a structured and semantically correct HTML webpage that includes a form to collect user input.
This will reinforce your understanding of key HTML tags such as <input>, <form>, <label>, and related attributes like type.

To help you get started, we've provided reference files:

    05-form1.html and 05-form2.html show how to create and structure forms with input elements

You are also given a partially completed template file called forms-1.html, which may contain syntax errors.
Your task is to identify and fix any issues, complete form section, and ensure your final output closely matches the provided screenshot.



Your Task

Create a form that collects participant information using various input types.

Complete the forms-1.html file to include the following:

    The form should submit data to /submit_survey using the POST method.
    Include an email input field for users to enter their email.
    Provide radio buttons for users to select their age group:
    18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46+
    Add a required checkbox that users must check to agree to participate.
    Include a hidden input field to send additional data (e.g., a survey ID).
    Provide a file input for users to upload documents.
    Use an image button (submit-animate.gif) as the forms submit button.



Tips & Expectations

    Review the reference files before starting. Try modifying them to understand how the tags behave.
    You're not required to copy the template or references exactly, but your final HTML file must closely match the expected output shown in the screenshot.
    Ensure your HTML is well-indented, semantically structured, and free of syntax errors.
    You may be graded on both functionality and semantic correctness.
