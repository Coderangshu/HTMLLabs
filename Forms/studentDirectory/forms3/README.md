Product Preference Survey

In this activity, you will design a multi-section product preference survey form using advanced HTML input types.
This will deepen your understanding of semantic grouping, validations, and modern input elements such as color, date, and range.

You are also provided with a partially completed template file called forms-3.html, which may contain errors.
Your task is to identify and fix any issues, complete the survey form, and ensure it matches the expected layout in the screenshot.



Your Task

Form Requirements:

    The form should submit data to /submit_survey using the POST method.

Design a comprehensive form divided into logical sections for personal, car, and phone preferences.

Complete the forms-3.html file to include the following:

1. Personal Information Section 

        Use a fieldset with a legend titled "Personal Information".

        Include a text input for the full name (only letters and spaces allowed).

        Add an email input with proper format validation.

        Include a date input for date of birth, ensuring the user is at least 18 years old.

2. Car Preferences Section

        Use a fieldset with a legend titled "Car Preferences".

        Include a color input to select preferred car color.

        Add a dropdown select for choosing a favorite car model:
        Sedan, SUV, Hatchback, Convertible

        Use a range input to select the carâ€™s age between 0 to 30 years.

        Provide radio buttons to indicate preference for an electric car.

3. Phone Preferences Section

        Use a fieldset with a legend titled "Phone Preferences".

        Include a color input to choose the phone color.

        Add a dropdown select for favorite phone brand:

Tips & Expectations

    Carefully review the structure of each section in the reference files.
